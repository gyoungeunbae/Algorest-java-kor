# ****JAVA Issue

#### 1. Eclipse console doesn't show the whole output.

â€‹	This is no bug. It is 1 of the changeable settings that Eclipse includes to make the output more readable. It can be changed by going to Windows --> Preferences --> Run/Debug --> Console and then unchecking "Limit Console Output" which is ON by default.
